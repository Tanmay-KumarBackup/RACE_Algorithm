# RACE Algorithm
In this repository i am trying to create a prototype of race algorithm in c++ code 
<hr>
RACE algorithm is a page replacement algorithm which helps for segmentation of the cache memory into three <br>
different section and which will also change their sizes Dynamically.<br>
You have to input total number of blocks, block value, inode, current time and Program Counter<br>
RACE algorithm will dynamically saperate the for different type of references and will allocate the space dynamically for each block<br>
there will be two tables File table and PC table will decide that how the partition is to be maintained.<br>
Dynamically the partition will change and will be displayed respectively.
